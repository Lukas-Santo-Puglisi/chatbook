# Project README (work in progress)

## Overview

Welcome to the TransformationForm project! This application is designed to provide a seamless and intuitive interface for users to upload and transform images. Our project integrates a variety of modern web technologies, focusing on image processing and manipulation using a React-based frontend and a MongoDB database for storage.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images to be transformed.
- **Transformation Types**: Supports various transformations like 'fill', 'remove', and 'recolor'.
- **Dynamic Image Processing**: Utilizes `next-cloudinary` for on-the-fly image transformations.
- **Responsive Form**: Built with React and `react-hook-form` for a smooth user experience.
- **Database Integration**: Utilizes MongoDB Atlas for storing image data, including metadata and URLs.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js (MERN stack)
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **Image Processing**: Cloudinary
- **Form Handling**: `react-hook-form` with `zod` for validation
- **State Management**: React Hooks (`useState`, `useTransition`)
